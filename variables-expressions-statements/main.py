# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b
# a = 10
# b = 20

# Output
# a=
# 20
# b=
# 10


# a = 10
# b = 20
#
# temp = a
# a = b
# b = temp
#
# print("a=")
# print(a)
# print("b=")
# print(b)


# Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then prints to the console the number of characters in the inputed name.
#
# Example:
#
# Input : "Elshad"
# Output : 6
# Hint:
#
# Google how can you find length of String in Python
#
# Input prompt has to be same to this. What is your name?

# name = input("What is your name?\n")
# print(len(name))

# PI = 3.14
# PI = int(PI)
# print(type(PI))
# print(PI)

# Data Types - Weeks in Years
# Write a program that converts number of years to the weeks. if the input was 2, then the output should be 2 * 52 = 104, because we have 52 weeks in 1 year.
#
# Example Input
#
# 2
# Example Output
#
# 2 * 52 = 104
#
# There are 104 weeks in 2 years
#
#
# Hint:
#
# The prompt for input function has to be as shown below, otherwise the test case will not work.
#
# 'Enter number of years'

# years = input('Enter number of years')
# weeks = int(years) * 52
#
# print(f'There are {weeks} weeks in {years} years')
